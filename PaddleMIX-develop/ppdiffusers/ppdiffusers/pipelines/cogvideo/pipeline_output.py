    Output class for CogVideo pipelines.

            List of video outputs - It can be a nested list of length `batch_size,` with each sub-list containing
            denoised PIL image sequences of length `num_frames.` It can also be a NumPy array or Torch tensor of shape
            `(batch_size, num_frames, channels, height, width)`.
